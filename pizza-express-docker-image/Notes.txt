I built the Pizza-Express from the Ubuntu 18.04 image, because the node.js image from the top is much bigger.
The Redis db server image I pulled from the top, then re-tagged and pushed it to the same repository with the
Pizza-Express image. In this way the images are placed together.

Images location on Docker Hub:
  docker.io/dimab07/pizza-redis
  docker.io/dimab07/pizza-express
